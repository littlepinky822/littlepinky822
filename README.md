### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ , it's Jess here.
I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Computing at Cardiff University, building on my background in BS.S.C Sociology from the Chinese University of Hong Kong. As a career switcher to tech, I'm excited to constantly learn and expand my skill set. I'm passionate about leveraging technology to make a positive impact and always striving to create meaningful solutions. Let's connect and collaborate!
